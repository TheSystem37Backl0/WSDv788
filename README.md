WSDv788 is a compilation of bat, vbs, and log files. However, it is NOT malware, and this is the official SFX (created by TheSystem37Backl0 and released BY TheSystem37Backl0). Nevertheless, the distribution of modified copies without direct permission from TheSystem37Backl0 is not permitted. Therefore, altered copies distributed by unauthorized third parties directly from TheSystem37Backl0 may contain malware such as adware, spyware, viruses, or even ransomware, worms, trojans, among others, embedded within the files or in the code of the files, which can steal data, harm your Windows system, or even hack bank accounts through data theft or hijacking (similar to how ransomware operates). Download WSDv788 only from official sources operated by TheSystem37Backl0 (such as TheSystem37Backl0's official profile on the Internet Archive or on GitHub) or directly from TheSystem37Backl0 via the official technical support contact of TheSystem37Backl0.

If you suspect that you have downloaded a modified or pirated copy, please contact the official technical support of TheSystem37Backl0 and send the SFX file that you suspect has been altered or pirated. Please remember that there is only one person who manages ALL emails and also updates and creates new versions of WSDv788 and other projects (such as 'The AttackScratch' developed on Scratch and electronic music). This means that your email may not always receive a response. Official Technical Support Contact (COST): thesystem37backl5@gmail.com
